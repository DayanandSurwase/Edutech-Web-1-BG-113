## 🏗️ System Overview

### 🔹 Development Stages

| Stage   | Description                 |
| ------- | --------------------------- |
| Static  | UI only (no backend)        |
| Hybrid  | Partial API integration     |
| Dynamic | Fully backend-driven system |

---

## 🧩 Functional Domains

1. Authentication
2. Dashboard
3. Goals
4. Study Planner
5. Practice Zone
6. Profile & Notifications

Each module evolves from:
**Local UI State → API → Database → Persistent System**

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 🔹 High-Level Architecture

```id="arch1"
Client (React App)
        ↓
API Layer (HTTP Requests)
        ↓
Backend (Node.js / Express)
        ↓
Database (MongoDB / Firebase)
        ↓
External Services (OAuth, Storage, Email, Realtime)
```

### 🔹 Architecture Style

* Client-Server Architecture
* RESTful APIs
* Modular and scalable design

### 🔹 Data Flow

**User Action → UI → API Call → Backend → Database → Response → UI Update**
